                        Second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor,
                        Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, but it is now a very different world.
                        Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction most planets do. Its thick atmosphere traps heat
                        in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar systemâ€”with surface
                        temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains.
