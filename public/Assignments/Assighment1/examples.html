            <div id="welcomeText">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="img/waterfall-model.jpg" alt="Waterfall Model" /><br>
                        <span class="hobby">Waterfall Model</span>. This SDLC model is the most seasoned and generally clear. With this philosophy, we finish one stage and afterward start the following. Each stage has its own smaller than expected arrangement and each stage "cascades" into the following. The greatest disadvantage of this model is that little subtleties left inadequate can hold up the whole procedure.
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="img/agile-model.jpg" alt="Agile Model" /><br>
                        <span class="hobby">Agile Model</span>. The Agile SDLC model isolates the item into cycles and conveys a working item rapidly. This philosophy creates a progression of discharges. Testing of each discharge encourages back data that is fused into the following variant. As indicated by Robert Half, the disadvantage of this model is that the overwhelming accentuation on client cooperation can lead the venture off course at times.
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="img/iterative-model.png" alt="Iterative Model" /><br>
                        <span class="hobby">Iterative Model</span>. This SDLC model underlines reiteration. Designers make an adaptation rapidly and for moderately little cost, at that point test and improve it through fast and progressive variants. One major hindrance here is that it can gobble up assets quick whenever left unchecked.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br /><br/>

                <div class="row">

                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="img/V-shaped-model.jpg" alt="V-Shaped Model" /><br>
                        <span class="hobby">V-Shaped Model</span>. An extension of the waterfall model, this SDLC methodology tests at each stage of development. As with waterfall, this process can run into roadblocks.
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="img/prototyping-model.jpg" alt="Prototyping Model" /><br>
                        <span class="hobby">Prototype Model</span>. This high-risk SDLC model throws most of its resources at development and works best for small projects. It lacks the thorough requirements definition stage of the other methods.
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="img/spiral-model.jpg" alt="Spiral Model" /><br>
                        <span class="hobby">Spiral Model</span>. The most flexible of the SDLC models, the spiral model is similar to the iterative model in its emphasis on repetition. The spiral model goes through the planning, design, build and test phases over and over, with gradual improvements at each pass.</div>
